    "# PDG Rounding Rule for quantities with uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDG uses a rounding rule for quantities with uncertainties. Here is the text description from \"REVIEW OF PARTICLE PHYSICS\", Chinese Physics C Vol. 40, No. 10 (2016) 100001:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"While the results shown in the Particle Listings are usually exactly those published by the experiments, the numbers that appear in the Summary Tables (means, averages and limits) are subject to a set of rounding rules. The basic rule states that if the three highest order digits of the error lie between 100 and 354, we round to two significant digits. If they lie between 355 and 949, we round to one significant digit. Finally, if they lie between 950 and 999, we round up to 1000 and keep two significant digits. In all cases, the central value is given with a precision that matches that of the error. So, for example, the result (coming from an average) 0.827 ± 0.119 would appear as 0.83 ± 0.12, while 0.827 ± 0.367 would turn into 0.8 ± 0.4.\""
